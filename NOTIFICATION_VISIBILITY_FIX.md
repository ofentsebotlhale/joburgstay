# 🔧 Notification Visibility Issue Fixed

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

**User Report**: "emails go thru, but on the website, there is no indication that shows the user that their booking was in fact sent and received."

### **Root Cause Analysis**

The notification system was using **Tailwind CSS classes** that weren't included in the compiled CSS file:

- `bg-green-500`, `bg-red-500`, `bg-yellow-500`, `bg-blue-500`
- `rounded-xl`, `shadow-2xl`
- `transform`, `translate-x-full`, `translate-x-0`
- `transition-all`, `duration-300`
- `fixed`, `top-4`, `right-4`, `z-50`
- `space-y-2`, `px-6`, `py-4`

**Result**: Notifications were being created in JavaScript but were **invisible** because the CSS classes had no styling.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **🎯 Custom CSS Implementation**

Replaced Tailwind dependency with **custom CSS styles** directly in `index.html`:

```css
/* Notification System Styles */
.notification-container {
  position: fixed;
  top: 1rem;
  right: 1rem;
  z-index: 9999;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

.notification {
  background-color: #10b981; /* green-500 */
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
  box-shadow: 0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
  transform: translateX(100%);
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
  max-width: 28rem;
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: 0.75rem;
}

.notification.show {
  transform: translateX(0);
}

.notification.error {
  background-color: #ef4444; /* red-500 */
}

.notification.warning {
  background-color: #f59e0b; /* yellow-500 */
}

.notification.info {
  background-color: #3b82f6; /* blue-500 */
}
```

### **🔄 JavaScript Updates**

Updated notification system in `app.js`:

**Before (Broken)**:

```javascript
container.className = "fixed top-4 right-4 z-50 space-y-2";
notificationDiv.className = `${style.bg} text-white px-6 py-4 rounded-xl shadow-2xl transform translate-x-full transition-all duration-300 max-w-md`;
```

**After (Working)**:

```javascript
container.className = "notification-container";
notificationDiv.className = `notification ${type}`;
```

### **🎨 Animation System**

**Before**: Used Tailwind transform classes

```javascript
notificationDiv.classList.remove("translate-x-full");
notificationDiv.classList.add("translate-x-0");
```

**After**: Uses custom CSS classes

```javascript
notificationDiv.classList.add("show");
// Remove animation
notificationElement.classList.remove("show");
```
