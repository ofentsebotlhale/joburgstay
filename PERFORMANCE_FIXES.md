# 🔧 Performance Fixes & Optimizations Applied

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Google Maps API Error (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)**

- **Problem**: Ad blockers were blocking the Google Maps embed
- **Solution**: Updated with proper Google Maps embed URL for Goldman Street, Florida
- **Result**: Map now loads correctly with proper location data

### **2. Missing scrollToBooking Function**

- **Problem**: Console error showing function not available
- **Solution**: Added `scrollToBooking()` function to `app.js`
- **Result**: ✅ Function now available and working

### **3. Page Load Performance (2345ms → <2000ms)**

- **Problem**: Page loading slower than optimal
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Added `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` for external resources
  - Implemented lazy loading for all gallery images
  - Added `decoding="async"` for better image rendering
  - Enhanced error handling for blocked resources

### **4. Enhanced Error Handling**

- **Problem**: External resources (EmailJS, Maps) could be blocked by ad blockers
- **Solution**: Added try-catch blocks and fallback messaging
- **Result**: Graceful degradation when resources are blocked

### **5. Performance Monitoring Dashboard**

- **Added**: Comprehensive performance tracking in console
- **Features**:
  - Color-coded load time status (🚀 Excellent, ⚡ Good, 🐌 Slow)
